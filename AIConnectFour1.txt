AI Strategy Overview for AIConnectFour1.py

1) High-level method
- The AI uses a Minimax search with alpha–beta pruning to evaluate future moves up to a fixed depth (default depth = 5).
- Before running the full search, it performs two fast tactical checks:
  a) One-move win: If the AI can win immediately by dropping a piece in some column, play it.
  b) One-move block: If the opponent can win on their next turn, block that column.
- If neither applies, it runs Minimax with alpha–beta pruning and a heuristic evaluation to pick the best column.

2) Move ordering (for better pruning)
- Valid columns are ordered by closeness to the center column. Center columns are tried first.
- This improves alpha–beta pruning efficiency and generally leads to stronger play.

3) Terminal conditions
- A position is terminal if either player has a 4-in-a-row or the board is full (draw).
- At terminal states, the score is a large positive value if the AI has won, a large negative value if the opponent has won, or 0 for a draw.

4) Heuristic evaluation (score_position)
- The board is scored by summing small “windows” of 4 cells in all directions (horizontal, vertical, and both diagonals). Each window is evaluated as follows (piece = AI piece, opp_piece = opponent):
  • Four AI pieces: +100000 (immediate win pattern)
  • Three AI + 1 empty: +100 (strong threat)
  • Two AI + 2 empty: +12 (mildly good)
  • Three opponent + 1 empty: −120 (urgent to block)
  • Two opponent + 2 empty: −10 (mildly bad)
- Center control bonus: Every AI piece in the center column adds +6 to the score.
- Net score = Sum over all windows and the center bonus. Higher is better for the AI.

5) Minimax with alpha–beta pruning
- Minimax explores moves alternately for the AI (maximizing) and the opponent (minimizing), reducing the search when alpha ≥ beta.
- Returns: (best_score, best_column) from the current position.
- Initial alpha = −1e9, beta = +1e9. Large positive/negative scores represent wins/losses.

6) Depth and responsiveness
- Default search depth is 5, which balances playing strength and responsiveness.
- Because move ordering prefers center columns, pruning is typically effective, keeping the AI responsive.

7) Summary of the playstyle
- Immediate tactics first (win if possible, otherwise block opponent’s win).
- Otherwise, play for:
  • Center control
  • Building 3-in-a-row threats
  • Avoiding giving the opponent easy 3-in-a-row threats
- The result is a solid, classical Connect Four AI that plays reasonably strong for fixed depth.

8) Possible improvements
- Iterative deepening with a time limit (keeps UI responsive while deepening when possible)
- Transposition table (memoize repeated positions)
- Improved evaluation (threat-space analysis, weighted rows by height, advanced patterns)
- Quiescence search (extend search in tactical positions)
- Parallel search (evaluate different first moves concurrently)
